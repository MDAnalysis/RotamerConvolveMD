Installation instructions
=========================

From the sources::

     python setup.py install --user

From a tarball

     pip install --user rotamers-1.0.tar.gz

or

     easy_install --user rotamers-1.0.tar.gz

Either form should automatically download required packages:

   * numpy
   * MDAnalysis

.. Note:: The package requires MDAnalysis 0.8 or a pre-release version
          as it makes use of some new features.

Please see http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com for hints if you have
problems with the automatic installation of MDAnalysis.

See README for further notes.
