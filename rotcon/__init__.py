Calculate a distribution of spin label distances from an MD trajectory
or an arbitrary ensemble of conformations by fitting Gunnar Jeschke's
rotamer library of MTSS (at 298 K) to a MD trajectory or another
ensemble of structures.


Summary
-------

This package analyses molecular dynamics trajectories or
conformational ensembles in terms of spin-label distances as probed in
double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments. The spin labels
are fitted on trajectories and the spin label mobility is taken into
account using a rotamer library.


Background
----------

Double electron electron spin resonance (DEER) is an EPR technique for
measuring distances between two spin labels that have been covalently
attached to a protein. Two cysteine residues are introduced into the
protein and subsequently labelled. The positions are chosen to report
on the expected conformational change. A commonly used spin label is
(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate
(MTSL). MTSL has a linker with five rotatable bonds and is therefore
very flexible. The distance distributions between the two spin labels
measured by experiments are typically broad and often multi-modal. The
distributions are therefore a convolution of the flexibility of the
MTSL spin label and the conformational spread of the proteins in the
sample. To ensure that we compared like with like we developed a
method that

(1) maps rotamer libraries of the MTSL spin label onto each position,

(2) discards those rotamers that sterically clash with the protein
    (typically distances <2 Ã…) and

(3) calculates all (weighted) distance pairs between the remaining
    rotamers and

(4) thereby estimates a distance distribution for that structure.

The code was written in Python using the MDAnalysis_ library
[Michaud-Agrawal2011]_ and a published rotamer library for MTSL
[Polyhach2011]_. It is available for download from the MDAnalysis
website, http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com.

Our approach improves upon the existing method [Polyhach2011]_ by
increasing computational efficiency and implementing, via the
MDAnalysis library, analysis of ensembles of hundreds of structures,
which allowed us to estimate distance distributions for entire
simulation trajectories.

Examples of the application of this approach can be found in
[Stelzl2014]_.
