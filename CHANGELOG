 MDAnalysisTestData CHANGELOG
==============================

The rules for this file:
  * entries are sorted newest-first.
  * summarize sets of changes - don't reproduce every commit log comment here.
  * don't ever delete anything.
  * keep the format consistent (79 char width, M/D/Y date format) and do not
    use tabs but use spaces for formatting
